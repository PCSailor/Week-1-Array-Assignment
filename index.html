    Description
    Loops, Arrays, and Concatenation
      </p>
      <p>
    Create a function that takes two parameters. The first parameter is an array, the second parameter will be a number.
    Your function should return a string that combines all of the values starting at the index of the number passed in through the end of the array.
      </p>
      <p>
    Examples:
    Example 1<br>
    console.log(yourFunction(["ASDF", "BLAH", "Oh! ", "Hi ", "There!"], 3));
    should log<br>
    Hi There!
      </p>
      <p>
    Example 2<br>
    console.log(yourFunction(["ASDF", "BLAH", "Oh! ", "Hi ", "There!"], 2));
    should log<br>
    Oh! Hi There!
      </p>

    Base Mode<br>
    With what you know now, we are going to create a build that encompasses the javascript we covered today in class.
    “Week 1 Array Assignment” is a name that would work well in this case.
    Create a new repository on GitHub,
    Create a new project (folder in this case) on your machine,
    Initialize a Git repository in that project (folder),
    Create an index.html and populate it with base functionality for an html page,
    Create an client.js file that will serve as your functionality for your site, make sure to include comments and the function of the code you wrote. Call this function several times to get different console.logs like the examples above
    Link the Javascript file to your HTML file,
    Push your completed project to the new GitHub repo
      </p>
      <p>
    Hard Mode<br>
    Create a README Markdown file and explain each of the files within the project
